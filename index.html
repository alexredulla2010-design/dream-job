	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>As a speech pathologist, I start my day at 6:00 AM with a peaceful and consistent routine, which consists of simple stretching and journaling, then followed by a nutritious breakfast. After the meal, I usually spend this time to go over the materials, goals, and therapy plans for the day. At 7:30 AM, I commute my way to the clinic, where I get ready mentally by going over my client's notes and listening to educational podcasts about child development and communication. Once I get to the clinic, I start arranging materials, checking emails, and setting up therapy areas with gadgets and activities designed to my client's requirements.</p>
	      <p>By 8:30 AM, the first therapy sessions of the day begins. I see several clients everyday, each with unique goals such as enhancing social communication abilities, language comprehension, fluency, or articulation. Inbetween sessions, I quickly records progress notes, reset activities, and collaborate with other people to support the client's progress. My morning in the clinic typically ends with a short review of session data and preparation for the next round of therapy later in the day.</p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>By midday, I switch from the busy pace of the morning sessions to a time of reflection and planning by taking a short lunch break, using this time to rest, to recharge, and to connect with my colleagues. Afterwards, I go over my morning session notes, update progress data, and adjust therapy goals based on each client's performance. I also use this time to prepare any materials and communication aids required for the afternoon. </p>
	      <p>Once I completed the preparations, I usually meet up with parents, teachers, or medical experts to coordinate care plans. I also use this time to preparing progress reports and creating individualized education plans (IEPs). Midday time in the clinic often combines documentation with collaborative work, giving me time to stay attentive to each clients' needs before starting another group of therapy sessions in the afternoon.</p>

	      <h2>Career Highlight Video</h2>
	      <p>This video shows something interesting about my dream job:</p>
	      
	      <video controls width="400">
	        <source src="dream job video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	      </video>

	      <p>This video shows a young girl identifying animals on an animal chart, which is an engaging activity used in speech pathology to improve language and communication skills. As she names each animal, she develops her vocabulary, articulation, and sound recognition skills, which are all important for making clear and confident speech. This exercise also helps the child connect letters to familiar words, while improving pronunciation and word recall. Although this activity can be seen just as playing, speech pathologists encourage children’s improved communication skills and voice confidence through enjoyable learning suh as this exercise.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from my job as a Speech Pathologist</h2>
	      <p>There was a time when I was assigned to help out Liam, a shy 7 year old who struggled with stuttering. When he first started therapy, Liam barely spoke, hinding his hands whenever he felt stuck. Over the weeks, I made lighthearted, stress relieving activities such as reading short stories, giving rhythm claps, and roleplaying as radio hosts to help him gain confidence. “You're the star of today's show, Liam,” I declared one day, pulling out a toy microphone.  </p>
	      <p>To my surprise, Liam took a deep breath and read the entire story without pausing. When he finished reading, he looked up at me and muttered, “I did it,” and we both felt a sense of accomplishment in the quiet room. Later that afternoon, Liam’s teacher said that he offered to read aloud in class for the first time. It is moments like this that remind me why I love my job, helping kids in discovering not only their voice, but also the confidence to use it.</p>
